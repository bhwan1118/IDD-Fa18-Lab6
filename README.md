# ChatBot

*A lab report by Ben Hwang*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

[Code](https://github.com/bhwan1118/IDD-Fa18-Lab6/blob/master/chatServer.js)

With regards to changes I made, I basically converted the normal chatbot to a "RudeBot". The line of questioning goes as follows:
1. What is your name? Response: That's an ugly name.
2. What is your age? Response: Calculate how many years from 100 you have left.
3. How old do you think I am (chatbot): Regardless of answer say: Younger than you!
4. What's your favorite color? : If it isn't red, ignore their response and change the screen to red anyway. If red then complement their taste.
5. Who's the farest one of all? : If it isn't Ben, give them a message saying you're wrong. If Ben, say perfect! 

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot
